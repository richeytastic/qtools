# QTools

Integrates and wraps Qt5 and VTK functionality.

## Prerequisities
- [r3dvis](../../../r3dvis)
- [Qt5](https://www.qt.io)
- [QuaZip](https://github.com/stachenov/quazip)

A version of QuaZip is included here (custom_quazip.zip) which uses customised CMake
scripts that leverage the build scripts of [libbuild](../../../libbuild) so that
QuaZip can be easily found when building FaceTools.

Download [libbuild](../../../libbuild) for easy build and install of this library.
